# Self-Watering Garden Automation Project

This project is a demo for the Self-Watering Garden Automation Project of the BHCC STEM club. It aims to automate the watering process of a garden using various sensors and actuators. The project is designed to be IDE-agnostic, meaning you can use any development environment of your choice.

## Hardware List

- Arduino Nano
- DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)
- Thermistor
- LCD Display
- Pump (coming soon)

## Information Gathered

- **Temperature and Humidity**: Measured using the DHT11 sensor to monitor the environmental conditions. (Air 
  Humidity and Temperature).
- **Soil Moisture**: Measured using the soil moisture sensor to determine the water content in the soil (0% to 100%).
- **Light Intensity**: Measured using the LDR to monitor the amount of light the plants are receiving (Measured in 
  "lux").
- **Temperature**: Measured using the thermistor to get an additional temperature reading for more accuracy.
